  description:
    "I'm a 24-year-old Junior DevOps Engineer with a Bachelor's in Applied Information Technology, currently studying at 42 Luxembourg. With a background in systems programming and a passion for automation, I build robust cloud-native infrastructure. I love transforming manual processes into automated, reliable workflows whether it's orchestrating Kubernetes clusters, building CI/CD pipelines, or implementing full-stack monitoring solutions. What drives me is reducing operational friction and creating environments that are scalable, secure, and fully automated.",
